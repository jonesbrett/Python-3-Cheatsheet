## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operators:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| + | Addition | x + Y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * Y |
| / | Division | X / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x // y |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to varialbes:

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | x += 3 | x = x + 3 |
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 |
| *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 |
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |
| //= | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 |
| **= | x **= 3 | x = x ** 3 |
| &= | x &= 3 | x = x & 3 |
| \|= | x \| = 3 | x = x \| 3 |
| ^= | x ^= 3 | x = x ^ 3 |
| >>= | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 |
| \<<= | x \<< = 3 | x = x \<< 3 |
