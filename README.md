## Tuples

A tuple is a collection which is ordered, indexed and immutable (they can not be changed).

```python
t = ('a','b','c')
t = 'a','b'.'c'     # Note Tuples can be written with the brackets too.
```

You can Concatenate Truples useing the + sign. #tuple1 + tuple2

```python
tuple1 = ('1','2','3')
tuple2 = ('a','b','c')

output = tuple1 + tuple2
print(output)
'1','2','3','a','b','c'
```
