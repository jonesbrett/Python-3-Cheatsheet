## Object-Oriented Programming

A class instance is also called an object. The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent 
the responsibilities of a program is known as Object Oriented Programming or OOP.

Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object, the type() function does the opposite of that. When 
called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.

```python
class CoolClass:
  pass
 
cool_instance = CoolClass()
print(type(cool_instance))
# prints "<class '__main__.CoolClass'>"
```

We then print out the type() of cool_instance and it shows us that this object is of type __main__.CoolClass.

In Python __main__ means “this current file that we’re running” and so one could read the output from type() 
to mean “the class CoolClass that was defined here, in the script you’re currently running.”

## Class Variables

When we want the same data to be available to every instance of a class we use a class variable. A class variable is a variable that’s the same for every instance of the class.

You can define a class variable by including it in the indented part of your class definition, and you can access all of an object’s class variables with object.variable syntax.

```python
class Musician:
  title = "Rockstar"
 
drummer = Musician()
print(drummer.title)
# prints "Rockstar"
```

Above we defined the class Musician, then instantiated drummer to be an object of type Musician. We then printed out the drummer’s .title attribute, which is a class variable that we defined as the string “Rockstar”.

If we defined another musician, like guitarist = Musician() they would have the same .title attribute.

## Methods

Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class. The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method. Convention recommends that we name this first argument self. Methods always have at least this one argument.

We define methods similarly to functions, except that they are indented to be part of the class.

class Dog:
  dog_time_dilation = 7
 
  def time_explanation(self):
    print("Dogs experience {} years for every 1 human year.".format(self.dog_time_dilation))
 
pipi_pitbull = Dog()
pipi_pitbull.time_explanation()
# Prints "Dogs experience 7 years for every 1 human year."

Above we created a Dog class with a time_explanation method that takes one argument, self, which refers to the object calling the function. We created a Dog named pipi_pitbull and called the .time_explanation() method on our new object for Pipi.

Notice we didn’t pass any arguments when we called .time_explanation(), but were able to refer to self in the function body. When you call a method it automatically passes the object calling the method as the first argument.

## Methods with Arguments

Methods can also take more arguments than just self:

class DistanceConverter:
  kms_in_a_mile = 1.609
  def how_many_kms(self, miles):
    return miles * self.kms_in_a_mile
 
converter = DistanceConverter()
kms_in_5_miles = converter.how_many_kms(5)
print(kms_in_5_miles)
# prints "8.045"

Above we defined a DistanceConverter class, instantiated it, and used it to convert 5 miles into kilometers. Notice again that even though how_many_kms takes two arguments in its definition, we only pass miles, because self is implicitly passed (and refers to the object converter).


Constructors

There are several methods that we can define in a Python class that have special behavior. These methods are sometimes called “magic,” because they behave differently from regular methods. Another popular term is dunder methods, so-named because they have two underscores (double-underscore abbreviated to “dunder”) on either side of them.

The first dunder method we’re going to use is the __init__() method (note the two underscores before and after the word “init”). This method is used to initialize a newly created object. It is called every time the class is instantiated.

Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated are called constructors. The word “constructor” is used to describe similar features in other object-oriented programming languages but programmers who refer to a constructor in Python are usually talking about the __init__() method.

class Shouter:
  def __init__(self):
    print("HELLO?!")
 
shout1 = Shouter()
# prints "HELLO?!"
 
shout2 = Shouter()
# prints "HELLO?!"

Above we created a class called Shouter and every time we create an instance of Shouter the program prints out a shout. Don’t worry, this doesn’t hurt the computer at all.

Pay careful attention to the instantiation syntax we use. Shouter() looks a lot like a function call, doesn’t it? If it’s a function, can we pass parameters to it? We absolutely can, and those parameters will be received by the __init__() method.

class Shouter:
  def __init__(self, phrase):
    # make sure phrase is a string
    if type(phrase) == str:
 
      # then shout it out
      print(phrase.upper())
 
shout1 = Shouter("shout")
# prints "SHOUT"
 
shout2 = Shouter("shout")
# prints "SHOUT"
 
shout3 = Shouter("let it all out")
# prints "LET IT ALL OUT"

Above we’ve updated our Shouter class to take the additional parameter phrase. When we created each of our objects we passed an argument to the constructor. The constructor takes the argument phrase and, if it’s a string, prints out the all-caps version of phrase.
