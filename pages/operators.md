## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operators:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| + | Addition | x + Y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * Y |
| / | Division | X / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x // y |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to varialbes:

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | x += 3 | x = x + 3 |
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 |
| *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 |
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |
| //= | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 |
| **= | x **= 3 | x = x ** 3 |
| &= | x &= 3 | x = x & 3 |
| \|= | x \| = 3 | x = x \| 3 |
| ^= | x ^= 3 | x = x ^ 3 |
| >>= | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 |
| \<<= | x \<< = 3 | x = x \<< 3 |


## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| == | Equal to | x == y |
| != | Not equal to | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| \< | Less than | x \< y |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| \<= | Less than or equal to | x \<= y |


## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| and | Returns True if both statements are true | x \< 5 and x \< 10 |
| or | Returns True if one of the statements is true | x \< 5 or x \< 4 |
| not | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x \< 5 and x \< 10) |
